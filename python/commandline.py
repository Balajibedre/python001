#### The Python Command Line

# To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the 
# code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.
# Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:

PATH # C:\Users\Your Name>python

# Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":

PATH #  C:\Users\Your Name>py
# From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier in the tutorial:

PATH  #  C:\Users\Your Name>python

# Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
# >>> print("Hello, World!")
# Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:

PATH  #  C:\Users\Your Name>python

# Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
# >>> print("Hello, World!")

# Hello, World!

# exit path

exit()
