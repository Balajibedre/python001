#### COMMENTS

#  Comments can be used to explain Python code.
#  Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
#  Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

####  Creating  Comment

NOTE # Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

Example
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")

print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment

#### A comment does not have to be text that explains the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

Example
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")

NOTE # Multi Line Comments

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

Example
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

NOTE # multiline string.

# multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

Example
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
